# You Gotta Give License (YGGL) 1.0

## Preamble

The You Gotta Give License 1.0 (YGGL 1.0 for short) has a straightforward idea that intends to keep projects running. This license is based on a simple concept, if you use something, you should give. It's just like PBS.


## You Gotta Give License (YGGL) 1.0

1. This software is free to use, it is completely user funded. You have the right to:
    1. Use the software for any purpose
    2. Distribute this software in any way that is in accordance to this license
3. If you use this software you will:
     1. There are no warranties offered or implied, none. 
     2. No matter what happens to you in anyway this software can't be found to cause damages. It's just code on a website, it's not an actual product.
4. If no one gives, the project will go dark. 
5. The project maintainers are completely underwater on this project and can't get a grip on it.
6. All forks and stars from users, those people give. A Lot of people give.
7. Giving in the terms of this license means something like the following:
    1. Donating money to the project maintainers or repository owners
    2. Donating money to the license creator
    2. Providing the source code, build scripts, installation scripts, and interface definitions in a form that is easy to get and best to modify
    3. Licensing it to everyone under YGGL without adding further restrictions to the rights provided

## License for the License
    
If you use this license, then you gotta give. When you give, YGGL continues perpetually, but if you don't give, your license rights end automatically (your licensees get to keep their rights if they abide). The terms of this license can't be modified or altered by anyone except its creator.
